# MoMath Hackathon 2017: Picture Fun

Project category: Math Square behavior
Team members: Zhendong Qin

The Math:
This project tries to present machine learning technology in an intuitive and fun way. It uses image recognition technology to create a face recognition activity on MoMath's math square. Users step on the math square touch screen to draw a face, and the program records the drawing and uses PCA/SVC logic with previous classified celebrity faces to find a close related person, then shows his/her face on the touch screen.

The Submission:
This project includes a javascript frontend and an ipython notebook backend. Math used in the project are PCA and SVC. The project is oriented for general audiences in the museum.
