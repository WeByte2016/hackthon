Picture Fun for Momath Hackathon
This project uses simple image recognition technology to create fun activity on MoMath's math square. Users step on the math square touch screen to draw a face, and the program records the drawing and uses PCA/SVC logic with previous classified celebrity faces to find a close related person, then shows his/her face on the touch screen.
